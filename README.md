# Learning
I am trying to create a browser, pixelated version of sketch pad.<br>
After finishing this project I will have foundational mastery on these:<br>

1. DOM(Document Object Model),
2. Flex Box,
3. Understanding the problem,
4. Breaking down those problem into chunks/sub problems,
5. Googling those sub problem and reading documentation to solve those sub problems,
